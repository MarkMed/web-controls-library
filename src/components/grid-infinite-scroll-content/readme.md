# gx-grid-infinite-scroll-content


This component has the infinite scroll logic. It requires a child component in order to display content.  This component displays the infinite scroll and changes the look depending on the infinite scroll's state. It displays a spinner that looks best based on the platform the user is on. However, the default spinner can be changed and text can be added by setting properties on the gx-infinite-scroll-content component.
