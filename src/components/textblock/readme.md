# gx-textblock

This is a simple element that allows showing text. Optionally, a URL can be specified in the `href` attribute, to behave as an anchor.

Take a look at the [common attributes, events and methods](../common/readme.md).

## Children

The text caption of the textblock will be its text content. Being a child instead of an attribute allows us to set text or HTML.

## Attributes

### href

This attribute lets you specify an URL. If a URL is specified, the textblock acts as an anchor.
